# 🧠 NeuralNetCPP: Neural Network from Scratch in Modern C++

A performant, modular Neural Network framework built from scratch in modern C++17 — **no external ML libraries**, just pure code, clean abstractions, and deep learning fundamentals implemented manually.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Fully custom neural network with trainable layers
- ✅ Forward propagation from first principles
- ✅ Support for dense (fully connected) layers
- ✅ Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- ✅ Written in clean and modular C++17
- ✅ Custom matrix library with SIMD/NEON support
- ✅ Fast unit tests powered by GoogleTest
- 🧱 Designed to grow: Add backprop, optimizers, and models

## 📌 Vision

This project aims to **demystify neural networks** by showing how they work under the hood, all without the help of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Eigen.

Whether you're a **quant**, **low-level dev**, or just want to **understand AI from first principles** — this project is for you.
